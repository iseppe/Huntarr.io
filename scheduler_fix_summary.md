# Scheduler Issue #556 Fix Summary

## Problem Description
Individual service enable/disable scheduling was not working properly. When users scheduled actions for specific services like "radarr-all" (all Radarr instances), the scheduler would log the action but not actually enable/disable the service. Global scheduling worked fine.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in `src/primary/scheduler_engine.py` in the `execute_action()` function:

1. **Frontend sends app identifiers like:** `radarr-all`, `sonarr-all`, `lidarr-instance1`, etc.
2. **Scheduler receives:** `app_type = "radarr-all"`
3. **Code tried to access:** `radarr-all.json` config file
4. **Actual config file:** `radarr.json` (base app name only)
5. **Result:** Config file not found, action failed silently

## Example of the Problem
```
User schedules: "Enable all Radarr instances at 10:00"
Scheduler receives: app_type = "radarr-all"
Code tries to open: /settings/radarr-all.json  ‚ùå (doesn't exist)
Should open: /settings/radarr.json  ‚úÖ (actual file)
```

## Solution Implemented
Added a helper function `get_base_app_name()` that:
1. Extracts the base app name from identifiers with suffixes
2. Validates against known app names
3. Returns the base name for config file access

### Code Changes
- **File:** `src/primary/scheduler_engine.py`
- **Function:** `execute_action()`
- **Changes:**
  1. Added `get_base_app_name()` helper function
  2. Modified individual service enable/disable logic to use base app name for config files
  3. Added better error handling for missing config files
  4. Maintained original app_type in logs and history for clarity

### Helper Function Logic
```python
def get_base_app_name(app_identifier):
    # "radarr-all" ‚Üí "radarr"
    # "sonarr-instance1" ‚Üí "sonarr" 
    # "global" ‚Üí "global" (unchanged)
```

## Testing Scenarios Now Fixed
‚úÖ **Individual Service Enable:** `radarr-all`, `sonarr-all`, etc.  
‚úÖ **Individual Service Disable:** `lidarr-all`, `readarr-all`, etc.  
‚úÖ **API Limit Setting:** Individual services with identifiers  
‚úÖ **Global Actions:** Still work as before  
‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Better logging when config files don't exist  

## Impact
- **Individual service scheduling now works properly**
- **Global scheduling continues to work unchanged**
- **Better error logging and debugging**
- **Maintains backward compatibility**
- **No changes needed to frontend or schedule data format**

## Issue Status
üéØ **RESOLVED** - Individual service enable/disable scheduling now works correctly across all supported *arr applications.
